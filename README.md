# BetterQWERTY

## What it does
Swaps the semicolon (;) key and the P key in the QWERTY keyboard.

## Why?
I HATE the STUPID semicolon key in QWERTY!!! It doesn't make any sense for it to be RIGHT OVER your PINKY when you NEVER USE it (or at least use it A LOT less than the LETTER P)[^1]

[^1]: OBVIOUSLY if you're coding in Java then this may not apply. But, NEWSFLASH, the majority of the FREAKING WORLD POPULATION that has TOUCHED A KEYBOARD are NOT Java developers.
